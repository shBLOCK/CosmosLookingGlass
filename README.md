### Assets
Some assets (in `/assets/generated/`) are generated by the `generateAssets` gradle task.  
These are tracked by version control since `generateAssets` only works on windows.

Assets are "deployed" (included in builds) by the `deployAssets` gradle task, this task handles merging static and generated assets and deploying them.
